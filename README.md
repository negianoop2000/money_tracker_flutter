# Money Tracker

Money Tracker is a Flutter-based application designed to help users manage their expenses and budget effectively. The app leverages providers for state management and uses SQLite (via `sqflite`) for local data storage. Comprehensive test cases have also been implemented to ensure the app's robustness and reliability.
